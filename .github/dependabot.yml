  # Note: Python dependencies are managed via uv (pyproject.toml + uv.lock)
  # Dependabot does not currently support uv natively. The "pip" ecosystem
  # expects requirements.txt files which this project doesn't use.
  #
  # For Python dependency updates, use:
  #   uv lock --upgrade           # Update all dependencies
  #   uv lock --upgrade <package> # Update specific package
